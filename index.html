These are our special release beers including our yearly aged Winter saison, Russian Imperial Stour, and other high gravity creations. Nurses know best.

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;While Kristi was training how not to kill people in nursing school she was taught the “5 Rights of Medication Administration” which are: Right Medication; Right Dose; Right Time; Right Route and Right Patient. Failing to check these “Five Rights” could lead to harming your patient, or even worse killing your patient. It is a tool used by nurses across the world to ensure the safe and thoughtful practice of medicine.
                    </p>

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;When we named our brewery Kristi and R.J. thought this concept was a natural fit to express our passion for doing what’s right for our customers. We at 5 Rights practice thoughtful brewing and care deeply about the product we share with our family and friends. Excellence in standard and practice ensure that the beer we make is worthy of our name. To quote Florence Nightingale: “I attribute my success to this: I never gave or took any excuse.”
